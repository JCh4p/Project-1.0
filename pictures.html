    <h2>Photography</h2>
    <p>The following pictures are some examples of both my portrait and landscape photos, both edited and un-edited. I have also included some more abstract photos of mine.</p>

    <img id="jam1" src="image/IMG_8093.JPG">
    <p>I've chosen this image to be placed at the top of my page as it is one of my favourite pictures I've taken. It was taken during a gig for a british artist called JamBaxter.</p>

    <p id="picdesc">The images above are from the Japanese Gardens in Newquay. I went there whilst on holiday and loved the scenery and the ammount of Dragonflies was incredible. The Dragonflies would be flying all around me landing next to me as if they wanted their picture taken.</p>
