## Description

In this project i showcase my photographic work, artwork both digital and physical and my mixed media work where i have taken photographs and created artowkr ontop of it. The use of this is to allow possible employers and fans to see my work and either request work or sales of my work. It also contains small descriptions of where I took photos what i used to create the artwork and where i took the photos. The page also contains an about me section on the home page with a navigation section above and my drawn signature underneith. I also chose a black background with white text for accesibility. I also added screen size accessibility so the pictures will scale with the size of the screen. I have included screenshots below of the navigation, contrast of colour, the form and the size difference on a computer and iPhone.
