    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>My name is James and im a budding photographer who loves to draw. I studied photography for 5 years and went to art college for a year to gain a diploma in art and design. I take pictures everywhere I go, wether it's a family holiday or a trip with friends or even just a walk around Bristol. I moved to Bristol when I was a child, the move to Bristol is what sparked my interest in Art and photography. All the graffiti everywhere and the high viewpoints that overlook the city and its artwork are my favourite parts of bristol.</p>
    <p>I also do photography jobs. Such as weddings, baptisms, parties and any other photographic jobs people may need.Please feel free to contact me through the contact page on this site if you wish to enquire about any photographic jobs you may need.</p>
